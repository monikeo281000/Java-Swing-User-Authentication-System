## Explanation Documentation: `RegistrationForm.java`

### Overview
`RegistrationForm.java` is a key component of the Java Swing User Authentication System, providing the graphical user interface for user registration. It inherits from `BaseForm` to leverage common UI functionalities and layouts, and it contains specific components and actions for registering a new user.

### Key Features & Demonstrated Programming Concepts

#### Inheritance
- **Inherits from `BaseForm`**: The `RegistrationForm` extends the `BaseForm` class, inheriting its layout and component creation methods. This allows for a consistent look and feel across different forms in the application.

#### Classes & Objects
- **Class Implementation**: The `RegistrationForm` class is a concrete implementation of the abstract `BaseForm` class, defining specific UI components such as text fields, password fields, and buttons.
- **Object Creation**: Instances of `RegistrationForm` are created and displayed when the user needs to register, demonstrating the practical use of objects in a Swing application.

#### Encapsulation
- **Private Members**: The class encapsulates its UI components as private members, ensuring they are only accessible and modifiable through the class's methods.
- **Public Methods for UI Actions**: Provides public methods to initialize components and layout the form, along with action listeners for handling user interactions.

#### Polymorphism
- **Method Overriding**: Overrides methods from the `BaseForm` class, such as `initializeComponents()` and `layoutComponents()`, to provide specific functionalities for the registration form.

#### Exception Handling
- **User Input Validation**: Incorporates basic validation for user inputs, handling scenarios like empty fields or mismatched passwords.
