## Explanation Documentation: `MainGui.java`

### Overview
`MainGui.java` serves as the primary entry point for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Java Swing User Authentication System. It initializes and displays the `LoginForm`, setting the stage for user interaction within the application.

### Key Features & Demonstrated Programming Concepts

#### Classes & Objects
- **Class Definition**: `MainGui` is defined as a class with the primary purpose of initializing and displaying the user interface.
- **Object Management**: It manages instances of `LoginForm`, demonstrating object creation and handling within a Swing application.

#### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulated Logic**: `MainGui` encapsulates the logic for creating and displaying the `LoginForm`, with methods like `createAndShowGUI` and `openLoginForm` controlling the form's initialization and visibility.
- **Private Members**: Utilizes a private static member `loginForm` to manage the form instance, ensuring controlled access and modification.

#### Static Methods
- **Static Main Method**: The `main` method is static, serving as the conventional entry point for the application.
- **Utility Methods**: Other static methods like `createAndShowGUI` and `openLoginForm` provide utility functions specific to GUI management.

#### Exception Handling
- **Swing Utilities**: Implements Swing's threading model using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` for thread-safe UI updates, which inherently handles UI-related exceptions.
