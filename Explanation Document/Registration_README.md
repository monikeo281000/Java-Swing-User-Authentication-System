## Explanation Documentation: `Registration.java`

### Overview
`Registration.java` plays a pivotal role in the Java Swing User Authentication System by managing the registration process for new users. This class ensures that user input is valid and stores the new user data appropriately.

### Key Features & Demonstrated Programming Concepts

#### Classes & Objects
- **Class Definition**: The `Registration` class defines the logic and procedures for registering new users in the system.
- **Object Usage**: An instance of `Registration` is created when the application needs to handle a new user's registration, demonstrating practical object-oriented programming.

#### Encapsulation
- **Private Data Handling**: The class encapsulates its functionality using a private `FileHandler` object to interact with the user data file.
- **Public Interface**: Exposes a public method `registerUser` which allows other parts of the application to perform user registration while keeping the implementation details private.

#### File I/O
- **Writing User Data**: Handles file I/O operations for storing new user data in the `userinfo.txt` file, a crucial aspect for maintaining persistent user information.

#### Exception Handling
- **Error Management**: Includes error handling logic, particularly in validating user inputs and file operations, to ensure the application handles erroneous scenarios gracefully.
