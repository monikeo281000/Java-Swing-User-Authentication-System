## Explanation Documentation: `FileHandler.java`

### Overview
`FileHandler.java` is a crucial component in the Java Swing User Authentication System. It handles file operations, such as reading from and writing to the user data file. This class plays a key role in persisting user information and ensuring data availability for other components of the system.

### Key Features & Demonstrated Programming Concepts

#### Classes & Objects
- **Class Structure**: `FileHandler` is designed as a class focused on file input/output (I/O) operations.
- **Object Utilization**: Instances of `FileHandler` are created to manage file interactions, demonstrating object-oriented programming in handling file-based data.

#### Encapsulation
- **Data Encapsulation**: The class encapsulates its file path and I/O operations, using private methods and variables to manage file access and modifications.
- **Public Interface**: It provides public methods to check for file existence, read data, and append data, allowing other classes to interact with files without direct access to the underlying I/O logic.

#### Exception Handling
- **I/O Error Management**: `FileHandler` includes robust exception handling for I/O operations, ensuring the application gracefully handles errors such as file not found or read/write issues.

#### File I/O
- **Core Functionality**: The class demonstrates extensive use of File I/O, reading user data from and writing data to a file, which is fundamental for user data persistence in the application.
