## Explanation Documentation: `BaseForm.java`

### Overview
`BaseForm.java` is an abstract class in the Java Swing User Authentication System that serves as the foundation for creating standardized Swing forms. It provides a common structure and essential functionalities for various user interface forms in the application, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.

### Key Features & Demonstrated Programming Concepts

#### Abstraction
- **Abstract Class**: `BaseForm` is defined as an abstract class, meaning it cannot be instantiated on its own but provides a template for other forms.
- **Common Functionality**: It defines common functionalities and layouts that other forms (like `LoginForm` and `RegistrationForm`) can inherit and use.

#### Inheritance
- **Inherits from `JFrame`**: `BaseForm` extends the `JFrame` class from Swing, inheriting its properties and methods for creating window-based applications.

#### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulated Properties**: The class encapsulates its layout and component properties (`font`, `gbc`) and provides protected methods to add and create UI components.
- **Controlled Access**: By using protected access modifiers, `BaseForm` allows subclass access to these methods while preventing unauthorized external access.

#### Polymorphism
- **Abstract Methods**: Contains abstract methods like `initializeComponents()` and `layoutComponents()`, which are implemented differently in subclasses, demonstrating polymorphic behavior.

#### Exception Handling
- **Robust GUI Creation**: While specific exception handling is not detailed in the provided snippet, Swing components inherently include mechanisms to handle UI exceptions.
